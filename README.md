ARIA-Compliant Front-End Showcase

Live Site: https://evanklem.github.io/ARIA-Basic-Site/
This repository contains the source code for a multi-page, accessibility-focused website built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Developed as part of a web design course, this project highlights my ability to create visually engaging, interactive, and inclusive web experiences that meet ARIA accessibility standards and adapt seamlessly across screen sizes and devices.

Key Learnings & Takeaways

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

Dynamic interactivity: Building responsive, user-driven web applications with vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks required.

Accessible design: Applying semantic HTML5 and ARIA attributes to support screen readers and inclusive navigation.

Visual integration: Incorporating custom digital assets while maintaining consistent design and usability.

Form logic & validation: Using programmatic input validation and efficient event handling for intuitive user interfaces.

Version control: Managing updates and code collaboration through Git and the command line.
